# Fries and PhoneGap

[Fries] is an awesome mobile development framework (yes, not just for prototyping!) 
for Android apps using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript and was inspired by [Ratchet].
We all know that you can find loads of iOS development tools out there, 
so this time let's give some love to Android.

### What's this?

This Android project is a demo of how you can integrate Fries with [PhoneGap].
It's pretty straightforward since you just have to copy your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files 
into the `/assets/www/` directory and run your application.

__Note:__ Make sure the paths to the Fries components in your HTML files are correct
to get it to work.
